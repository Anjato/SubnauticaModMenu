# Subnautica Mod Menu

First time creating a mod for a game. I haven't actually played through Subnautica yet but wanted to get into reverse engineering and this game happeend to be one I wanted to play and seemed quite easy to make mods for. As I play through the game and understand more features within the game, I'll add more features in the mod menu and probably continue creating mods for BZ as well.

`Note: These definitely won't be the only updates I plan on making, they are only what I can currently think of from what I've been browsing in dnSpy. I literally haven't even gotten 15 minutes into the game before starting to reverse engineer the game so I'm not exactly sure what most of the things in the game are. This mod is going to be focused as a cheat menu but will focus on and create QoL mods once I actually start playing the game and get ideas and hopefully some other fun and creative ideas :).`

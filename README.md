# Subnautica Mod Menu

First time creating a mod for a game. I haven't actually played through Subnautica yet but wanted to get into reverse engineering and this game happeend to be one I wanted to play and seemed quite easy to make mods for. As I play through the game and understand more features within the game, I'll add more features in the mod menu and probably continue creating mods for BZ as well.
